# CryptoClustering

This project uses K-Means clustering to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over various periods. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies together. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to streamline the clustering process by reducing dimensionality.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Hvplot
Scikit-learn
Warnings

### Conclusion

Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction resulted in more compact clusters, demonstrating that a reduced set of features can effectively represent the data for clustering. This method simplifies the model while preserving essential information.
