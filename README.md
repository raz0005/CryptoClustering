CryptoClustering
Project Overview
This project aims to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages over various time periods using K-Means clustering. The analysis seeks to uncover patterns and group similar cryptocurrencies together. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to streamline the clustering process by reducing dimensionality.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is a CSV file named crypto_market_data.csv, located in the Resources directory.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
Hvplot
Scikit-learn
Warnings
Conclusion
Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction resulted in more compact clusters, demonstrating that a reduced set of features can effectively represent the data for clustering. This method simplifies the model while preserving essential information.
